# Stack Questions
Technical questions may be different, but they will all be aimed at revealing your knowledge and your level. If you don't know the correct answer to a question, feel free to say so. This will save time for both you and the interviewers.

Interviewers often choose a strategy where the complexity and depth of questions grows until you hit the ceiling of your current knowledge. This allows interviewers to understand your current level and whether it is enough to solve the company's problems.

Remember, the more detailed the answer, the more profound knowledge the interviewer will note for himself.

## Consider the main topics for questions you may encounter:
- ### [Python.](/Python_General.md) 
Here are some general questions about Python and data types
- ### [Asynchrony and concurrency in Python.](Asynchrony_and_Concurrency_Python.md) 
For answers, you need to remember everything you know about asynchrony from the GIL to coroutines and generators
- ### [OOP.](OOP.md)
OOP is often asked general questions, but you may come across questions related specifically to Python. Also, we can talk about different patterns
- ### [SQL.](SQL.md)
Questions aimed at knowledge of SQL databases and SQL dialect. The questions can be adapted for example to PostgreSQL or MySQL
- ### [NoSQL.](NoSQL.md)
This block of questions may arise if you have worked with NoSQL databases
- ### [Testing.](Testing.md)
It can be about your testing experience when you write tests, and about different hacks in the tests themselves.

Repeat everything on the topics from the “Questions about the stack” block - the more thoroughly, the better. Here is the finished checklist:
- [ ] [Python](/Python_General.md)
- [ ] [Asynchrony and concurrency in Python](Asynchrony_and_Concurrency_Python.md) 
- [ ] [OOP](OOP.md)
- [ ] [SQL](SQL.md)
- [ ] [NoSQL](NoSQL.md)
- [ ] [Queues](Queues.md)
- [ ] [Architecture](Architecture.md)
- [ ] [Testing](Testing.md)

## Signs of the Middle+ level in these blocks:
- You have experience with microservice architecture, as well as experience in splitting a monolithic application into microservices.
- You worked with a company-relevant stack. This is not only about Python, but about all technologies, storages, queues and CI / CD.
- You talk about the disadvantages of blindly following the requirements in response to the question about good / bad practice.
- If you do not know ready-made solutions, you can come up with them based on your experience and knowledge.
