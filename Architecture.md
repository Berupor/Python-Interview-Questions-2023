# Architecture

During interviews with senior developers, a separate interview is allocated to test the skill of an architect. In the case of a middle developer, this block may not exist.

If it does get included in the interview program, it might be limited to a couple of questions about your experience and case studies, such as why you chose that particular architecture in a particular case. It may seem that the interviewer thinks your solution is not the best, but it is not. The interviewer needs to understand how you made the decision. If the choice of architecture and solution was not made by you, feel free to say so.

It is equally important to understand the basic postulates of the architecture: extensibility, scalability, fault tolerance. Look at sample questions:

- You have your own online cinema. How to implement the functionality of email-sending to users?
- How can a service or database be scaled?
- Tell me what is balancing? What balancing algorithms do you know?
- If you were making an online movie theater, how would you implement video uploads? How would a video player work?
